Building a predictive model to assess the likelihood of customer defaulting requires fairness to prevent discrimination based on sensitive features. Defaulting on a credit card is defined as failing to make the minimum payment for at least 180 days. We plan to explore whether we can find a risk prediction model that is fair across different subgroups (male/female, education) that still remains accurate. \n","\n","The original source for the data can be found here: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["#### **Previous Work**\n","Our previous work involved auditing the Rotterdam welfare fraud detection algorithm using the synthetic dataset and model obtained by the data journalists at Lighthouse Reports and Wired. We spent the first half of our time working on Phase 2 using that dataset. This included translating the feature names from Dutch to English, calculating summary statistics for the dataset, and attempting to train an unsupervised model on the data provided. However, we decided to pivot from this to the credit card defaulting data for two main reasons. First, as noted in the methodology article from Lighthouse Reports, we do not have any of the target values about whether or not the individual did infact commit fraud. This made it extremely difficult for us to analyze the accuracy of the model used by the government in Rotterdam as well as our own model. Realistically, we would have only been able to use statisical parity as a metric for fairness, and we would have no ground truth labels. Secondly, the provided model was in R, and while we were able to load it into our notebook, the strucutre of the model was extremely unclear. We were unable to successfully use the Rotterdam model on the dataset. For these reasons we have pivoted to algorithmic detection of credit card defaulting."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":117,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import sklearn\n","from sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["#### **Data Import and Cleaning**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":118,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>LIMIT_BAL</th>\n","      <th>SEX</th>\n","      <th>EDUCATION</th>\n","      <th>MARRIAGE</th>\n","      <th>AGE</th>\n","      <th>PAY_0</th>\n","      <th>PAY_2</th>\n","      <th>PAY_3</th>\n","      <th>PAY_4</th>\n","      <th>PAY_5</th>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <th>BILL_AMT4</th>\n","      <th>BILL_AMT5</th>\n","      <th>BILL_AMT6</th>\n","      <th>PAY_AMT1</th>\n","      <th>PAY_AMT2</th>\n","      <th>PAY_AMT3</th>\n","      <th>PAY_AMT4</th>\n","      <th>PAY_AMT5</th>\n","      <th>PAY_AMT6</th>\n","      <th>default payment next month</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>20000</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>24</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>-1</td>\n","      <td>-1</td>\n","      <td>-2</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>689</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>120000</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>26</td>\n","      <td>-1</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>3272</td>\n","      <td>3455</td>\n","      <td>3261</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1000</td>\n","      <td>1000</td>\n","      <td>1000</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>2000</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>90000</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>34</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>14331</td>\n","      <td>14948</td>\n","      <td>15549</td>\n","      <td>1518</td>\n","      <td>1500</td>\n","      <td>1000</td>\n","      <td>1000</td>\n","      <td>1000</td>\n","      <td>5000</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>50000</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>37</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>28314</td>\n","      <td>28959</td>\n","      <td>29547</td>\n","      <td>2000</td>\n","      <td>2019</td>\n","      <td>1200</td>\n","      <td>1100</td>\n","      <td>1069</td>\n","      <td>1000</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>50000</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>57</td>\n","      <td>-1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>-1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>20940</td>\n","      <td>19146</td>\n","      <td>19131</td>\n","      <td>2000</td>\n","      <td>36681</td>\n","      <td>10000</td>\n","      <td>9000</td>\n","      <td>689</td>\n","      <td>679</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>5 rows × 24 columns</p>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["   LIMIT_BAL  SEX  EDUCATION  MARRIAGE  AGE  PAY_0  PAY_2  PAY_3  PAY_4   \n","0      20000    2          2         1   24      2      2     -1     -1  \\\n","1     120000    2          2         2   26     -1      2      0      0   \n","2      90000    2          2         2   34      0      0      0      0   \n","3      50000    2          2         1   37      0      0      0      0   \n","4      50000    1          2         1   57     -1      0     -1      0   \n","\n","   PAY_5  ...
